# Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems using DeAuthentication packets.

Abstract With the uncontrolled growth of the internet, maintaining its security is a complex task. 
Hackers find newer and very sophisticated tools to attack the system and compromise the security goals.
Attacks against the data link layer, ranges from ARP cache poisoning for wired clients to deauthentication of wireless clients. 
Sophisticated hackers perform attacks which often go unnoticed by intrusion analysts since intrusion detection systems typically look at the network layer and above to detect attacks.
The proposed technique can augment existing capabilities by detecting attacks that may be blind to your IDS.
This system will be efficient for average user who cannot afford time and money to buy wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) or afford to manage intrusion detection system sensors behind every layer 2 devices.
